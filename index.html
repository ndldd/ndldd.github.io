    <h2>Wubi trainer (work in progress)
    </h2>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="description">

            An online typing tutor for the chinese "Wubi" input method (五筆字型輸入法).
            Intended for learners of chinese as a foreign language.
        </div>

        <ul>

            <li>

                Wubi is a input method that allows to type chinese characters based on their
                components and overall structure. This is helpful when memorizing how different characters
                look and very useful for chinese learners. Unfortunately there are not many Wubi-learning
                resources available for non-native speakers.

            </li>
            <li>
                The app is keyboard-centered and provides feedback for: Wrong or correct input, overall progress, and
                warnings
                for difficult characters.

            </li>
            <li>

                It allows to practice the keyboard-location of the character components as well as the sequence for
                whole characters.
            </li>
